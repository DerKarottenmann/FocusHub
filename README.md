# FocusHub

**FocusHub** is a compact device for your desk that helps you stay focused and productive. It combines modern technology with clever features to optimize your workday and keep your goals in sight.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**  
  Integrated LED strips visualize your work and break intervals according to the Pomodoro method.

- **Timer Customisation**  
  Adjust the length of work and break phases to suit your individual needs.

- **OLED Display for Goals & Weather**  
  A single (OLED) display shows both your goals and reminders as well as weather data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. If you have multiple goals, they are displayed as a scrolling or alternating text.

- **Progress Ring**  
  A progress ring shows the percentage of your learning progress for the entire day—not just a single interval.

- **Vibration & Sound**  
  Gentle vibrations remind you of breaks or when to start learning.

- **Streak System**  
  Build a learning or work streak (similar to Duolingo) and see when you were active.

- **Battery Backup**  
  Thanks to the built-in battery, you can take FocusHub anywhere and maintain your streak even without a power supply.

- **Custom Colors**  
  Adjust the device’s colors to match your setup and personal vibe.

- **2 LED Strips**  
  Two separate LED strips visualize break and learning times in parallel.

- **Custom LED Panel**  
  Small LED panel for visualizing your streak (learning/work series) in a unique way.
  Possibly similar to the GitHub Contributions Graph.

- **Buttons & Push Dial**  
  Physical controls (e.g., a push dial) for quick operation and adjustment directly on the device.

- **Wi-Fi & WPS (ESP32)**  
  Network functionality via an ESP32 module, easy setup through a website for online services.

- **Web Configuration (Wemos hosts website)**
  The Wemos provides a website at the push of a button. On this website, you can securely enter the SSID and password for Wi-Fi, as well as the device’s color scheme and basic settings, so that Wemos takes over the configuration. No native app needed—the configuration is done via the browser.
